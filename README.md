# SFML Sand Game

## What is this project about?
This is a small project which I used to learn some more c++, It simulates particles like sand, water, fire, wood etc.
You choose the particles by pressing 0-9 on your keyboard and then holding the mouse button over the place where you want to place them.
## Libraries used
This project uses the [SFML Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
## Compilation
### Linux
To compile it on linux you need to have sfml installed. If you have it installed then just run the `debug.sh` (makes and starts a debug file) or `compile.sh` (makes a release version of the game).
### Windows
TBD
